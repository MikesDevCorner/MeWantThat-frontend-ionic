# Me Want That - Ionic / Vue Frontend

This piece of software is a mobile application, built with Vue on top of Ionic 5 and Capacitor. It started 2020 as an example for a Masterthesis about Mobile Cross Platform Development (Tag v2.0). 

## Prerequisites

You're going to need
* NodeJS
* NPM
* Vue CLI 3


installed and available on your commandline. I recommend Visual Studio Code with Vue and Ionic Plugins as preferred Development IDE. For Building the Project, Android Studio comes in handy.

## Some useful commmands

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

```bash
npm install -g ionic@latest
```

```bash
npm add @ionic/vue@0.0.9
```

```bash
npm add @ionic/core
```

```bash
npm run serve
```

```bash
npm install --save @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
```

```bash
npx cap init -â€“web-dir=dist
```

```bash
npm run build
```

```bash
npx cap copy
```

```bash
npx cap sync
```
